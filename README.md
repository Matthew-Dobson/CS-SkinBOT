CS
Skin Purchasing Bot
This Python bot automates the process of purchasing CS
skins from online marketplaces. It monitors two APIs (SkinBaron and PriceEmpire) to find profitable items, analyzes the price difference, and attempts to buy the skins if they meet the defined profitability criteria. The bot is equipped with robust error handling and sends notifications for purchase attempts.

Features
Marketplace Monitoring: Fetches real-time skin data from SkinBaron and PriceEmpire APIs.
Profitability Calculation: Analyzes prices from both platforms to determine the potential profit.
Automated Purchasing: If the conditions meet your defined thresholds, the bot attempts to buy the skin.
Error Handling: Robust error handling ensures the bot operates reliably.
Notifications: Purchase attempt notifications are sent through your preferred method (email, SMS, etc.).
